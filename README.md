# Castlery_OmniChannelAnalysis
**Key Problem:**
Castlery faces alignment challenges between its online and offline experiences, particularly in Singapore, where showroom sales contribute heavily. Significant drop-offs at critical online stages—specifically from "pageviews to 'Add to Cart'" and "checkout to purchase"—suggest potential gaps in the customer journey. Additionally, refining pricing and product positioning across channels is essential to maximize revenue and effectively target high-value items. Resolving these issues is vital to creating a seamless omnichannel strategy that resonates with customers and drives sustained growth.

**Objective**
To gain actionable insights that drive customer engagement, boost conversions, and increase revenue across Castlery’s online and offline channels. 
This analysis will focus on:
Optimizing the Customer Journey: Identify and resolve friction points across both digital and showroom touchpoints to streamline the shopping experience and improve conversion rates.
Channel-Specific Pricing Strategy: Assess how pricing affects purchasing decisions in each channel to implement targeted pricing approaches that resonate with specific customer segments.
Strategic Product and Brand Positioning: Evaluate product and brand performance in online vs. offline settings to prioritize high-performing items and tailor marketing strategies to customer preferences.
