# Castlery_OmniChannelAnalysis
**Key Problem:**
Castlery faces alignment challenges between its online and offline experiences, particularly in Singapore, where showroom sales contribute heavily. Significant drop-offs at critical online stages—specifically from "pageviews to 'Add to Cart'" and "checkout to purchase"—suggest potential gaps in the customer journey. Additionally, refining pricing and product positioning across channels is essential to maximize revenue and effectively target high-value items. Resolving these issues is vital to creating a seamless omnichannel strategy that resonates with customers and drives sustained growth.

**Objective**
To gain actionable insights that drive customer engagement, boost conversions, and increase revenue across Castlery’s online and offline channels.

Channel-Specific Pricing Strategy: Assess how pricing affects purchasing decisions in each channel to implement targeted pricing approaches that resonate with specific customer segments.

**Recommendations:**

1. Marketing Strategy to Bridge Online and Offline Behavior
 - Showrooming Strategy:
Use QR codes on showroom product displays that link to detailed online product pages, where customers can view additional images, specifications, and customer reviews and complete purchase with promotional discounts that are only available online. This will connect offline visits with online conversions.
Offer showroom-exclusive QR code discounts redeemable online to encourage users to transition their journey from offline to online. For instance, a 15% discount if the item is purchased within 24 hours of showroom interaction.
 - Reverse Showrooming (Webrooming):
Allow customers to initiate their journey online by browsing products and completing purchases in-store with dedicated sales assistance. Create a seamless “Save and View In-Store” option on online product pages, allowing customers to create a list of items to see in person at the nearest showroom. Send notifications or updates when a customer is near a specific location. Offer price matches or in-store promotions for online items to incentivize showroom purchases.

3. Targeted Price Sensitivity Campaigns
 - Dynamic Pricing Tiers:
Tactic: Focus on high-revenue price segments like $1,000–$1,500 for online premium items. Offer options like interest-free installments or bundle discounts (e.g., a coffee table with a matching sofa) to make premium items more accessible.
Implementation: Use online and in-store banners and email marketing to promote financing options and bundle discounts for high-revenue items in target price ranges.
 - Segment-Specific Promotions:
Tactic: Use customer segmentation based on past purchasing behaviors (e.g., premium spenders vs. budget-conscious buyers) and target them with price-sensitive promotions.
Implementation: For high spenders, send personalized messages offering exclusive early access to high-ticket items or flash sales in the $1,000+ range. For budget-conscious buyers, promote discounts on mid-tier items to encourage upselling.

4. Personalized Marketing and Retargeting
 - Cross-Channel Cart Recovery:
Create personalized email and SMS retargeting campaigns for users who abandon their cart. Offer showroom consultations or online discount codes to complete the purchase.
Design retargeting emails with dynamic content reflecting the specific items left in the cart and their availability in-store. Include call-to-action buttons like “Complete Purchase Online” or “See Item In-Store,” depending on the customer’s browsing patterns.
 - Behavior-Driven Campaigns:
Target customers who view high-ticket items (e.g., $1,000+) multiple times without purchasing, sending them personalized retargeting messages encouraging them to complete their purchase or book a showroom appointment.
Use data on time spent and number of visits to high-ticket product pages to identify likely buyers. Trigger customized ads or emails offering online-only perks or appointment booking for showroom viewing.

5. Unified Omnichannel Experience
 - Omnichannel Cart Access:
Enable customers to start a shopping cart online and finalize the purchase offline, or vice versa, by implementing a unified cart system.
Integrate Castlery’s online platform with in-store POS systems so customers can view and modify their cart across both environments. Include features like digital cart QR codes that customers can scan in-store to continue their online cart in the showroom.

6. Integrated Loyalty Program:
Introduce a points-based loyalty program that rewards customers for purchases across online and offline channels. Points can be redeemed for discounts, exclusive products, or VIP access to sales.
Assign points for each purchase made, with multipliers for purchases in high-revenue categories or referrals. Create loyalty tiers with increasing benefits, e.g., Silver (early access), Gold (VIP events), and Platinum (personal shopper).

7. Conversion Funnel Optimization Focused on Cross-Channel Insights
 - Unified Cart and Checkout Experience:
Enable customers to start a cart online and complete the purchase offline, or vice versa. This unification can improve conversion rates by reducing the friction caused by customers switching channels.
 - Cross-Channel Cart Recovery Campaigns:
Develop email and SMS campaigns specifically for users who abandon their carts across different channels. For instance, if someone adds items to their cart online but doesn’t purchase, offer showroom-based assistance or promotions.

8. Enhanced Customer Journey Experience
 - Streamlined Checkout:
Reduce the number of steps in the online checkout process and optimize in-store checkout flow by training staff to assist customers with digital checkout options.
Offer a guest checkout option, minimize required fields, and integrate multiple payment options to reduce friction. In-store, equip staff with tablets to assist with on-the-spot checkouts for high-traffic periods.
 - User-Generated Content and Reviews:
Improve trust on product pages by featuring customer reviews, user photos, and visual content from social media.
Encourage customers to submit reviews and photos post-purchase by offering incentives like loyalty points or discounts. Highlight these reviews on relevant product pages, especially for high-consideration items.
